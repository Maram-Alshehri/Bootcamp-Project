# Project Proposal Template
The use of mobile devices in combination with the rapid growth of the internet has
generated an information overload problem. Recommender systems are essential for
determining which data are useful to the user. However, numerous parameters, such as
location, screen size, and processing speed, are critical to information retrieval on mobile
devices. Therefore, this project is proposed to build a Smartphone Recommendation System.

# Smartphone Recommendation System
The use of mobile devices in combination with the rapid growth of the internet has
 generated an information overload problem. Recommender systems are essential for
  determining which data are useful to the user.
However, numerous parameters, such as
 location, screen size, and processing speed, are critical to information retrieval on mobile
 devices. Therefore, this project is applaying two approches of collaborative filtering that are SVD and KNNmeans to build a smartphone recommendation based on
 Kaggle dataset.
 
 This repo contains :
 
 1- Proposal 
 
 2- MVP
 
 3- Recommendation System code 
 
 4- Presentation
 
 5- Recommendation System writeup
 
 To run the code:
 
 First you should downloud the dataset for Kaggle website "
https://www.kaggle.com/dsrivastava2020/recommendation-system ".

Then, change the path of Recommendation System code and run it.

# Smartphone Recommendation System
The use of mobile devices in combination with the rapid growth of the internet has
 generated an information overload problem. Recommender systems are essential for
  determining which data are useful to the user.
However, numerous parameters, such as
 location, screen size, and processing speed, are critical to information retrieval on mobile
 devices. Therefore, this project is proposed to build a smartphone recommendation based on
 Kaggle dataset.
